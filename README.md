# Book Donation App with Firebase Authentication

## Overview

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application that includes Firebase for authentication and signup functionalities. Users can donate books by entering book details with input validation and error handling. The application provides a responsive user interface with proper input validation and error handling.

## Features

1. Users can donate books by entering book details with input validation and error handling.
2. The last column in the table includes two actions: "edit" to make the row editable and move to the first cell, and "delete" to delete the record.
3. The application allows dumping the state in JSON format, including user information and donated book records.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** Database system
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Firebase:** Authentication and signup functionality
